# Nextflow-mtDNA-project
This project is an investigation into the genetic regulation of the mitochondrial transcriptome in whole blood, and its role in common disease risk. This is the culmination of several months of work under project supervisor Alan Hodgkinson, as an extended research project during my MSc in Applied Bioinformatics at King's College London.
